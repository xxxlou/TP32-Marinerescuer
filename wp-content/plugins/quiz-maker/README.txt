Here are presented some of those settings:

= Quiz with timer =

You can set a timer for your quiz and when the timer ends,the quiz will be submitted automatically. A quiz timer option is very useful for making an online exam or test. So we can call it WordPress Exam plugin too. 


= Quiz results, scores and data form =

After successful completion of the quiz, you can track from your dashboard your visitors' results, duration, when they start and when they end the quiz.
We have created beautiful form and you can choose fields of the form from the dashboard and assign this form to your quiz ( After or Before quiz ) and when the user finishes the quiz you can collect data and have beautiful **statistics** on your dashboard. This data allows you to create your **email and SMS marketing**, which will attract much more users from your specific target.
There are 3 static form fields in the free version` name, email and phone. For more custom fields you need to upgrade to the [PRO](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/quiz-maker/) version.
Also, results' statistics with **graphs and export functionality** available only in the Pro version.


= Results page on the front-end =

You are free to choose what your visitors should see after completion of the **Quiz, Exam or Test**.
- Show progress bar with the percentage on the final step
- Show only percentage of result
- Show **fail or pass messages**
- Show user mistakes on final page
- Show correct answers of each question (if the user selected wrong answer this question will be marked with red marker and when user selected right answer question will be marked with green marker)
- Make use of **Message variables** to show user data individually such as user name, results by category, wrong and right answers count, quiz time, and so on.
In the Premium version there is a shortcode for registered users, which you can paste in users page for showing their history.


= Survey =

Using our plugin you can make a Survey too. We have made text and number question types and also **No influence to the score** option.
It means that questions will not be counted for the final result. It stands as a survey plugin too. Also, you can make quiz and survey mix. You can enable the **Hide score** option from the quiz settings and you will just collect the data which users filled in the survey.
Check out the [Survey Demo](https://quiz-plugin.com/wordpress-quiz-plugin-free-demo/#ays-quiz-container-14).

= Quick Quiz =

We have also created  another huge opportunity. You can create a quick quiz from the dashboard without visiting the questions page or quiz page. Just click on a quick quiz button and you'll see a **modal window** with an opportunity to add questions and save the quiz, but note that it is only for adding a new quiz. For editing quiz you should do the steps as usually you edit quizzes or questions.

= Quiz themes, styles and live preview =

There are 6 themes available for making awesome quizzes.
You can choose one of them and then customize it with our 40+ style options (colors, backgrounds, borders). Also, there is a **live preview** feature in the style section in the dashboard, which allows the admin to see every change of options. There is no need to save and go to the front-end to see changes in styles. *Have fun!*

= Quiz user restriction =

You can restrict your users by enabling and selecting user roles from the dashboard and only selected users with given roles can pass your quiz. If you don't want to restrict your quiz by role, we have created another opportunity for you, just enable **"Only for logged in users"** option and write some message to non-logged in users, by this way you can enlarge your community. If your quiz is interesting non-registered users will register on your website for passing the quiz and you will have ultra **traffic** on your website. Please note that by selecting restriction by user roles,the quiz will automatically select only for logged in users option.

= Quiz social sharing =

Also, users can share your quiz, test or exam in their social networks **(facebook, linkedin, twitter)**, which is important for your **SMM** and increases your **website traffic** and popularity.

== Additional Shortcodes ==

We have developed extra shortcodes to present more data and statistics about your users on the front end. Here are some of them:
- Single quiz results
- All results
- Question bank

Do you wonder how to create a Math Quiz with hard mathematical equations in WordPress? It is easier than you think.

For adding the math equations just install and activate the mentioned plugin. It is one of the easiest math plugins. With the help of it, you can add as many equations as you need, even if they include several symbols. In this [demo](https://www.mathjax.org/#demo), you can see a step-by-step tutorial on how to use MathJax. You have to be careful to use less-than signs, ampersands, and other HTML special characters within your math equations.
For example, to add a squared symbol, you need to write down the following sign ^2. (do not forget to insert $ character to mark the beginning and ending).
